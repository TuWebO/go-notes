## Variables and declaration sintax

[Useful C sintax reading - The Clockwise/Spiral Rule](http://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html)

###Variables
1. Basic types  
   ```
   bool

   string

   int  int8  int16  int32  int64
   uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

   byte // alias for uint8

   rune // alias for int32
        // represents a Unicode code point

   float32 float64

   complex64 complex128
   ```  
2. A var statement can be at package or function level.  
3. The var statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument lists, the type is last.  
   Also note that variable declarations may be "factored" into blocks
   ```Go
   
   var c, python, java bool  
   var (
	  ToBe   bool       = false
	  MaxInt uint64     = 1<<64 - 1
	  z      complex128 = cmplx.Sqrt(-5 + 12i)
   )
   
   ```  
4. A var declaration can include initializers, one per variable. If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted; the variable will take the type of the initializer.  
   ```Go
   
   var i, j int = 1, 2  
   var c, python, java = true, false, "no!"
   ```  
5. Inside a function, the **:= short assignment** statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type.  
   Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available.  
   Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.  
   ```Go
   
   var i, j int = 1, 2  
   k := 3  
   c, python, java := true, false, "no!"
   ```

###Arrays & slices
[Go slices usage and internals](http://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals)  
Arrays have their place, but they're a bit inflexible, so you don't see them too often in Go code. Slices, though, are everywhere. They build on arrays to provide great power and convenience.  

1. An array type definition specifies a length and an element type.  
   Unlike an array type, a slice type has no specified length.  
   ```Go
   
   // An array literal can be specified like so:  
   b := [2]string{"Penn", "Teller"}  
   Or  
   b := [...]string{"Penn", "Teller"}
   ```  
   ```Go
   
   // A slice literal is declared just like an array literal, except you leave out the element count:    
   letters := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}  
   // A slice can be created with the built-in function called make, which has the signature,  
   func make([]T, len, cap) []T  
   // The make function takes a type, a length, and an optional capacity. When called, make allocates an array and returns a slice that refers to that array.  
   var s []byte
   s = make([]byte, 5, 5)
   // s == []byte{0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
   ```
